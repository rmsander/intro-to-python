# Introduction to Python

This repository contains Python files that I created for teaching introductory Python to high school students in Amman, Jordan through [Injaz](http://injaz.org.jo/), a Jordanian non-profit focused on education and entrepreneurship.  For distributing these exercises to students, I used these segments of code along with [repl.it](https://repl.it/~) and tinyurl links for students to easily access and work through these exercises.  

These Python files contain exercises covering the following introductory Python concepts:

1. **Data Types**

2. **Variables**

3. **Lists and Loops**

4. **Dictionaries**

5. **Input/Output**

6. **Functions**

7. **Applied Concepts: Ciphers, RSA Encryption, Simple 2D Robotic Navigation, Probability, Kinematic Physics**


The slides that cover these concepts can be found in this repository under [lesson_slides.pdf](https://github.com/rmsander/intro-to-python/blob/master/lesson_slides.pdf).
